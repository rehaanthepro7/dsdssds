# PRO-C27-BUILDING-BLOCKS
Mark went to the construction site with his dad where he saw a crane being used to arrange blocks one above the other. Being inspired, he decides to build a project to create building blocks. He has used a mouse pressed event rather than a crane and added an Object-Oriented Programming concept to create the number of blocks.
